## This is a template:
The point of this script is not to just *drag and drop. neato new job*, but for you to be able to duplicate this and create multiple simple jobs, sort of like the basic A to B esx jobs. Note that this is supported for **ox_core**, but if you know what you're doing I'm sure you can edit this script so it would fit with your framework. I encourage you to take this and learn from it, see if you can add some new features or make some radical change.

Self plug, but if you like the work, you can help me inject caffiene here:
