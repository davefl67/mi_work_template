# ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS! ðŸš§

*This is another fork from MIAgimir. This is his work template for ox_core. When I grow up, I will release something for [ND Framework](https://github.com/ND-Framework).*

---
The point of this script is not to just *drag and drop. neato new job*, but for you to be able to duplicate this and create multiple simple jobs, sort of like the "basic A to B" ESX jobs. Note that this is supported for **ox_core**, but if you know what you're doing I'm sure you can edit this script so it would fit with your framework. I encourage you to take this and learn from it, see if you can add some new features or make some radical change.

## Features included:
* Script based salary (credit to FlakeSkillz for creating the paycheck method)
	* Set payrate for each group and grade
	* Change interval of payouts
	* Enable / disable salaries entirely
* Uniforms for male / female models
	* Customize outfits in the config file for job
	* Access wardrobe from same menu for changing back
* Vehicle spawn based on group and owned by player
	* Ownership relinquished when returning vehicle
	* Checks vehicle has group so personal vehicles are not deleted
* Simple A to B tasks for players to accomplish
	* Job spawning / interacting with peds
	* Job spawning / interacting with objects
* Simple teleport system
	* Context menu for choosing location to tp
